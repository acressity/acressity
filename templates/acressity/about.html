		One's life journey can be compared to the symbolic act of ascending a mountain's peak within an expansive range of mountains. During moments of existential reflection, we conjure a peak representing the realization of our yearnings, dreams, hopes, and aspirations. Setting off on the trail of which direction is determined by this peak, we soon find ourselves enveloped in the particular details of the immediate trail.
	</p>
	<p>
		Often, we stray off the path toward more immediate goals. While this meandering adds to the variety of life and provides the potential for the redefinition of which mountain to ultimately ascend, it can also lead to stagnation within the comfortable valleys or the life-robbing entrapment within marshes or swamps. At times like these, it is important to have the ability to reach out of the mires and grab ahold of something substantial to again find oneself upon a fruitful trail.

		See for yourself the power that comes from the simple act of bringing into the physical world a thought of experiencing something you've always wanted to do. Be it a simple willingness to try something new, an action that deviates from the norm, the wish to extend your current comfort zone, the yearning to quell a former fear by exposing yourself to the source of the fear, or any number of reasons, this website works to facilitate this inherently human willingness to know the world through exploration and exposing oneself to new experiences.
	</p>
	<p>
		Being presented with the choice	between comfort and risk, it is those who are willing to endeavor, explore,	and be adventurous who truly experience what it means to be alive and therein cross into extraordinary.
