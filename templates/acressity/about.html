            The most direct means of knowing yourself and the universe is through experience. This
            website is built to facilitate experiencing those things on your <abbr
                title="List of special experiences being sought">bucketlist</abbr>. Create a list of things you want
            to experience and let this be the canvas upon which you&#8212;the explorer&#8212;paint your journey. Each
            thing on your list, referred to
            as an experience, allows you to write narratives to log your progress and thoughts, upload and display
            photos, and network with others by sharing your experience with them or creating a joint experience where
            each explorer involved can make their own contributions.
        </p>

        <p>
            Use this application as a tool for hoisting yourself towards your goals, transcending your comfort zone
            in favor of experiencing life truly.
            Let it be the map upon which you chart your adventure, the platform from which you announce your
            intentions to the rest of the world,
            the photo album
            where you record
            images of your
            experiences, and the paper upon which you compose your narratives which immortilize your experiences. Use
            it as a private journal or as a public forum&#8212;sharing your experiences with
            the
            rest of the world so they may experience vicariously through you.

            This application aims to encourage a fulfillment of the yearnings for exploration within everyone. It
            assumes that simply writing down the experiences that one wishes to pursue and providing a canvas for the
            expression of the experience provides tremendous potential for the formation of personal drive, and then
            aims to facilitate following through on those experiences.
        </p>

        <p>
            It's assumed that most everyone gains tremendously from experiencing new activities, places, foods,
            environments, fears, ways of thinking, ad infinitum. These experiences seem to exist just beyond our comfort
            zones, and this website aims to facilitate the uncomfortable&#8212;but rewarding&#8212;venture into the
            unknown. There is an emphasis placed on the growth that comes from the experience and the expression of the
            journey. It encourages you to express the experiences upon which you envision yourself following through in
            your personal

        <p>
            One's life journey can be compared to the symbolic act of ascending a mountain's peak within an expansive
            range of mountains. During moments of existential reflection, we conjure a peak representing the realization
            of our yearnings, dreams, hopes, and aspirations. Setting off on the trail of which direction is determined
            by this peak, we soon find ourselves enveloped in the particular details of the immediate trail.
        </p>

        <p>
            Often, we stray off the path toward more immediate goals. While this meandering adds to the variety of life
            and provides the potential for the redefinition of which mountain to ultimately ascend, it can also lead to
            stagnation within the comfortable valleys or the life-robbing entrapment within marshes or swamps. At times
            like these, it is important to have the ability to reach out of the mires and grab ahold of something
            substantial to again find oneself upon a fruitful trail.
        </p>

        <p>
            See for yourself the power that comes from the simple act of bringing into the physical world a thought of
            experiencing something you've always wanted to do. Be it a simple willingness to try something new, an
            action that deviates from the norm, the wish to extend your current comfort zone, the yearning to quell a
            former fear by exposing yourself to the source of the fear, or any number of reasons, this website works to
            facilitate this inherently human willingness to know the world through exploration and exposing oneself to
            new experiences.
        </p>

        <p>
            Being presented with the choice between comfort and risk, it is those who are willing to endeavor, explore,
            and be adventurous who truly experience what it means to be alive and therein cross into the extraordinary.

	<h2>Give Me the Facts: Purpose of Website</h2>
	<p>
		The <span class="description" title="Term meaning 'quality or state of being at the peak of existence'">Acressity</span> application can be thought of as a collection of evolving adventure novels&#8212;called journeys&#8212;with each journey being uniquely created, written, decorated, and owned by an <span class="description" title="Registered user of the site">explorer</span>. The journeys are encouraged to be filled with as many chapters&#8212;called experiences&#8212;by the explorer as they please.
	</p>
	<p>
		Any amount of pages&#8212;called narratives&#8212;and photos can be created by the explorer to chart the movement along and growth within the experience. Any aspect of the journey can be changed and rewritten by the explorer at any time, and they can choose to make each of their <span class="description" title="Chapters of the adventure book">experiences</span> public or private.
	</p>
	<p>
		Social networking is encouraged by providing explorers the ability of inviting others&#8212;called comrades&#8212;to an experience, thus creating a jointly owned experience. A comrade who has accepted an invitation is granted privileges that include writing narratives and adding photos.
	</p>
	<h2>In Summation</h2>
	<p>
		Use this web application as a tool to chart your thoughts, status, and progress into new experiences with written narratives and uploaded photos. Use it as a free-standing online journal for expression of experiences of your own, invite others to become involved in a shared experience, or read about the journeys of other explorers.
