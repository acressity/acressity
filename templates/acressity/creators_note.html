			This site was originally launched as an individual project named Interpopulus. Feeling the urge to set out upon broadening my understanding of the world and expand my comfort zone by embracing a variety of diverse life experiences, I composed a short list of experiences.
		</p>
		<p>
			Specifically, Interpopulus began as an experiment to see how publicizing certain aspirations, hopes, and dreams online could facilitate the experience.
		</p>
		<p>
			The experiment yielded powerful positive results, and I made the decision to make the same resources available to others. The intention of this website is to provide for you a personal domain in which you can share and build towards life experiences in your journey. You are now looking at the most up-to-date expression of this ongoing venture.
		</p>
		<p>
			My hope is that you find this web application useful in facilitating your pursuits. I wish you the best with your journey, whether or not you immortalize any of your experiences within these pages.
